# Video-Sharing-Site-2015
This was my first coding project ever, started in late 2015.

The website is a video sharing service that let's you upload and watch other user's videos, in addition setting up an account with login credentials.

The purpose of this exercise was to test methods of hacking into the site using it's login page. Basic security measures like MD5 hashing on passwords are employed to provide security.
